2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks eth_rx_clk_pin and hehxd_n_6 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks eth_rx_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks hehxd_n_6]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks eth_rx_clk_pin and hehxd_n_6 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks eth_rx_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks hehxd_n_6]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.090 ns between aes/data_out_TOP_reg[90]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and hehxd/data/data_reg[2]/D (clocked by hehxd_n_6). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.135 ns between aes/data_out_TOP_reg[9]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and hehxd/data/data_reg[1]/D (clocked by hehxd_n_6). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.417 ns between aes/data_out_TOP_reg[14]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and hehxd/data/data_reg[6]/D (clocked by hehxd_n_6). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.772 ns between aes/data_out_TOP_reg[29]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and hehxd/data/data_reg[5]/D (clocked by hehxd_n_6). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.816 ns between aes/data_out_TOP_reg[7]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and hehxd/data/data_reg[7]/D (clocked by hehxd_n_6). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.729 ns between aes/data_out_TOP_reg[12]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and hehxd/data/data_reg[4]/D (clocked by hehxd_n_6). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.839 ns between aes/data_out_TOP_reg[67]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and hehxd/data/data_reg[3]/D (clocked by hehxd_n_6). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

TIMING-16#8 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.376 ns between aes/data_out_TOP_reg[96]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and hehxd/data/data_reg[0]/D (clocked by hehxd_n_6). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
